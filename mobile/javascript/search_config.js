DESIGN \& PATTERN SHOP                    Product Design                  Auto CAD is the best CAD software for making and editing 2D drawings very quickly and prominently.                  Advantage: For using this software, the design department does not use manual paper drawings, which                  takes thrice the time to make a 2D drawing.                  Creo Parametric is one of the best parametric software for making the 3D Model to visualize the                  model even before making the practical model.                  Making the 3D CAD model gives the exact weight of the product by inputting the material properties                  of the product as per customer requirement at the very first stage, which helps reduce the price of the                  product compared to other manufacturers.                  Creo Simulate is an analysis software to do the stress analysis/ load test on the product to check the                  sustainability of the product on a particular load.                  It helps optimizing the design of the product to create less weight and negate rejection.                  Pattern Design                   Autodesk Power Shape is a 3D modelling system to make the 3D model easily, fast, and prominently.                  Very easy \& fast to modify \& recover the imported model from other 3D modelling software.                  Autodesk Power Mill software by which we can make the perfect CNC program for machining the                  product accurately with optimized machining time \& visualize the whole product machining of the product                  before practical product machining. Achieving accurate dimension of product as per the design model                  after machining.
