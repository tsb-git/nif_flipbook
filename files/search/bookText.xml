                  DESIGN & PATTERN SHOP


                 Product Design
                 Auto CAD is the best CAD software for making and editing 2D drawings very quickly and prominently.
                 Advantage: For using this software, the design department does not use manual paper drawings, which
                 takes thrice the time to make a 2D drawing.
                 Creo Parametric is one of the best parametric software for making the 3D Model to visualize the
                 model even before making the practical model.
                 Making the 3D CAD model gives the exact weight of the product by inputting the material properties
                 of the product as per customer requirement at the very first stage, which helps reduce the price of the
                 product compared to other manufacturers.
                 Creo Simulate is an analysis software to do the stress analysis/ load test on the product to check the
                 sustainability of the product on a particular load.
                 It helps optimizing the design of the product to create less weight and negate rejection.
                 Pattern Design

                 Autodesk Power Shape is a 3D modelling system to make the 3D model easily, fast, and prominently.
                 Very easy & fast to modify & recover the imported model from other 3D modelling software.
                 Autodesk Power Mill software by which we can make the perfect CNC program for machining the
                 product accurately with optimized machining time & visualize the whole product machining of the product
                 before practical product machining. Achieving accurate dimension of product as per the design model
                 after machining.
                 We are equipped to manufacture accurate metallic and non-metallic patterns in-house with the help of
                 Vertical Machining Centre (VMC) & Computer.
